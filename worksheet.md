# Creating your own quiz using Kids Ruby

Ruby is an easy to learn language that was created in the late 1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto as a general purpose programming language. In fact Ruby is the language that is used to create music in Sonic Pi. In this tutorial we will create a quiz using a special application called Kids Ruby.

###Creating the sequence
Our quiz is split into three sections of code

- An introduction
- Questions
- Game Over & Final Score

So let's step through each of these sections and understand how they work.

## Step 1: Introduction. Welcoming the player
In the introduction we first create a variable.

*Variable: A variable is a container into which we can store data. Think of it as an empty box, we can put anything inside of it and then name it for later use.*

In the introduction we create a variable called *answer* and we store a blank value inside of it. We we cover why we do this later in the project.

```Ruby
answer = " "
```
Our attention now turns to welcoming the player. We use *alert* to create a pop up box that welcomes the player to the game.

```Ruby
alert "Welcome to the Hour of Code Quiz"
```
Next we create a new variable called *name* and in there we store the answer to a question that we *ask* the player, that question being "What is your name?"

```Ruby
name = ask "What is your name?"
```
For the next line of our quiz we greet the player by their name, which has has been saved as the variable *name*. But we do something rather clever with this, we use *alert* to create another pop up box that joins "Hello " and the players name together. This is called concatenation.

*Concatenation: Concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball".*

```Ruby
alert "Hello " + name
```
Next we create a new variable called *score* which will contain the players score. The initial value stored is zero, which is a number, to be exact it is an integer.

*Integer: Is a number that can be written without a decimal place, such as 1, 5 and 9.*

```Ruby
score = 0
```
The last part of our introduction is another *alert* advising the player of their score, which at the start of the game is always zero. You can see that we are again using *concatenation* to join "Your score is " to their actual score. But can you see that score is a little different?
Concatenation can only join *strings* together and our score is an *integer* so the two cannot be joined. To join them together we must temporarily alter score to become a *string* and this is done via *score.to_s*.

*String: A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, for example "Hello" is a string.*

```Ruby
alert "Your score is " + score.to_s
```

## Step 2: Asking Questions and Working With User Input
A quiz needs questions, but how do we know if the player has answered them correctly?
In programming we can compare an answer given by the player to what the correct answer is, and until this answer is correct the player cannot progress through the quiz. In Ruby we can instruct the code to repeat a sequence until a certain *condition* is met. In this case we ask a question to the user and give them three possible answers, labelled A, B or C
In the example below, until the player chooses **A** the code will continue to loop.

```Ruby
until answer == "A"
```
So we have set the condition, now we must create the manner in which we ask the player a question. To do this we return to using an *alert*. You will see in the Question text there is **\n** this is an instruction to create a new line of text underneath, similar to when you press Enter on your keyboard.

```Ruby
  alert "Question 1 - Where does Father Christmas / Santa Claus live?\nA: North Pole. B: Santa Monica. C: Cambridge"
 ```
With the question asked we now need to capture their answer and to do that we use *ask* to capture their answer and store it as a variable called *answer*. You'll remember that we created a variable called *answer* at the start of the quiz. Inside that variable we stored a blank value **" "** we did this so that the program would progress. If we hadn't of done this then the quiz would of stopped before it asked the first question.
 
```Ruby
  answer = ask "What is your answer?"
 ```
 
 Now we compare the answer given against the correct answer, and to do this we use an *if* statement.
 
 *if: A conditional statement, where if the condition is met an action is taken.*
 
 In this quiz we ask 
 
 *if the answer given by the user is not the same as "A"*
 
```Ruby
  if answer != "A"
 ```
 So if the answer given by the player is not the same as the answer that we expected, then an alert is created informing the player of a wrong answer and that they should try again.
 
```Ruby
    alert "I'm sorry that's the wrong answer, try again"
  end
end
```
If the player answers correctly, they will skip past the previous loop and will carry on from this point. 
We create a new *alert* that congratulates the player on their correct answer. We then increase their score by 1 point and then inform the player of their current score. Lastly we reset the *answer* variable to blank ready for the next question.

```Ruby
alert "Correct - Well done!!!"
score = score + 1
alert "Your score is " + score.to_s
answer = " "
```
Questions 2 and 3 follow exactly the same pattern as Question 1, the code below is simply changed so that we can ask different questions.

```Ruby
until answer == "A"
  alert "Question 2 - Which reindeer has a bright red nose?\nA: Rudolph. B: Prancer. C: Vixen"
  answer = ask "What is your answer?"
  if answer != "A"
    alert "I'm sorry that's the wrong answer, try again"
  end
end
alert "Correct - Well done!!!"
score = score + 1
alert "Your score is " + score.to_s
answer = " "
until answer == "C"
  alert "Question 3 - What helps reindeer to fly?\nA: Burgers. B: Chicken. C: Magic dust"
  answer = ask "What is your answer?"
  if answer != "C"
    alert "I'm sorry that's the wrong answer, try again"
  end
end
alert "Correct - Well done!!!"
score = score + 1
alert "Your score is " + score.to_s
answer = " "
```

## Step 3: Game Over and Final Score
For the last line of our quiz we create a final alert in the same manner as we previously have. This alert informs the player of their score and that the game is now over.

```Ruby
alert "Congratulations you scored "+score.to_s+"\n GAME OVER"
```
Putting this all together it looks like this
